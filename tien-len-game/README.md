# Tiến Lên

Tiến Lên is a Vietnamese [card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti%E1%BA%BFn_l%C3%AAn#Rules) using the [standard deck of fifty-two playing cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck).

Tiến Lên is a _climbing game_ in which the aim is for players to get rid of their cards as soon as possible by beating combinations of cards played by the other players. Each player in turn must play a higher card (or combination of cards) than the previous player. A player who cannot or does not wish to beat the previous play can pass. This continues for as many rounds as necessary until someone makes a play which no one will beat. That player wins the "trick" and leads to another one.

The objective of the game is for a player to be the first to get rid of all of his cards by playing various combinations.
